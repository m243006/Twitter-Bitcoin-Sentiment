You cannot increase the supply of bitcoin because it is of fixed supply.‚Äù https://t.co/gTXSoFNWyQ via @crypto_potato #Bitcoin #Cryptocurrency #BTC

When #Bitcoin breaks 30k it‚Äôs going to 20k quicker than you think. Low volume between 30k and 20k  cause it to move fast. No fundamental bias there, that‚Äôs just the chart talkin

Remember, gov‚Äôt ‚Äúgoing after crypto‚Äùmeans they are going after peopleYou can‚Äôt stop #bitcoinYou can only oppress people

#BTC price is falling amd whales are accumulating more n more BTC. Yellow line is the purchase trend of those wallets who have 0 history of selling #BTC. These wallets dnt sell they only buy. Whales dnt buy #BTC at the start of bear market that aggressively. https://t.co/1TIZwFobLP

Dead cat bounce?#Bitcoin

Are you buying #bitcoin at $29k --- will you have cash to buy #BTC at $29k These are things you should answer now, not during a possible drop.

The bigger amount of people keeping their #bitcoin on exchanges the higher the supply side inflates. Of course they fuck around with ‚Äúyour coins‚Äù.  Not your keys, not your coins. Get your coins and wallets in order!

@IEBengaluru #Bitcoin is dipping deeper into the old resistance area in an effort to flip it into a new support area weekly retest in progress @10Ethbtc is a super underrated BitcoinerI've been taking her tweets and tips seriously &amp; I've been doing superb

@saylor You're still trying to push #BTC? üòÜI'll buy it when it crashes. Not buying at these levels.

Once you hit that conviction level where you realize you don‚Äôt own nearly as much #BTC¬† as you want, the emotions towards price fluctuations flip (to some degree). Now I‚Äôm not so sure what would make me more sad/fearful, price dumping or pumping.

@CynthiaMLummis Eventually the state will come for our #bitcoin

#ltc is just patiently looking at #btc and not giving a fuck xD i love #litecoin

@IncomeSharks comparing to what¬¥s being happening to #Bitcoin B in the last months, the stocks are holding well tbh.

@adamcurry @ShortNon @RTLZ @SBS6 @RTL7 @JinekLive @HumbertoTan Dutch mainstream media FUD the hell out of #Bitcoin. It‚Äôs unbearable to watch. Fuck ‚Äòem!

It is important to keep emotions in check. Ponzi always look great and give amazing returns until the last moment. #BTC is a ponzi that will come to an end because it is not useful for daily transactions. If you want to use crypto for daily transactions, it's Bitcoin Cash #BCH.

Plenty of warning was given, I said 0.069 wasn‚Äôt off the table, and warned today it was becoming more likely. As I repeat all the time, it‚Äôs up to you to make your own judgment, however if you listened to my words and made a call to dip out, well done. #IOTX #btc
